## Data binding in AngularJS
every component has one component class and one rendering file called html (view template). 
in html file we bind the data inside the {{ <data binding> }} tag and declaration present in class file

there are two types of data binding. 
1. one way data binding 
    in one way data binding we bind class file data in html. 

    String Interpolation: in Angular is used to bind data from component to view, that mean data flow from component to view.


    
2. two-way data binding
    in two-way data binding we bind class file data in html and vice versa
